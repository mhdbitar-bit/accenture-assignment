# Game of Thrones app

It's a simple App that fetches a list of categories and stores it inside the app's file system. After the fetching process has been done a list of categories will be presented using **UITableView** and if the user selects one of the presented categories it will fetch the information of that category and display it on another page.
 
I separated the app into two test targets one for main **Unit Tests** and the other for **End to End Tests** multi targets to make the tests run faster because End to End tests usually are slower than Unit tests.  
 you can run the test by clicking âŒ˜ + U
 
## App Architecture :

I applied clean architecture in all my modules. you can see that the app is including the following modules:
 - API module
 - Cache module
 - Feature/Domain module
 - UI and Presentation module

For the ***Presentation module*** I used **MVVM** Design pattern, and I've tried to decouple all my modules using protocols, so you can find that I hide the implementation details by using protocols.

For the ***Caching module*** I used **File System** to store the categories I know we can use **UserDefault** to store because it's simple data just an array of Strings, so I made my solution replaceable so you can replace it by using any kind of persistent.
